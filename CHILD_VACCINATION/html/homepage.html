                <h1>Vaccination Is Safe</h1>
                <p> Vaccines are only given to children after a long and careful review by scientists, doctors, and
                    healthcare professionals. Vaccines will involve some discomfort and may cause pain, redness, or
                    tenderness at the site of injection, but this is minimal compared to the pain, discomfort, and
                    trauma of the diseases these vaccines prevent. Serious side effects following vaccination, such
                    as
                    severe allergic reaction, are very rare. The disease-prevention benefits of getting vaccines are
                    much greater than the possible side effects for almost all children.
                </p>
                <h2>Immunization protects future generations</h2>
                <p> Vaccines have reduced and, in some cases, eliminated many diseases that killed or severely
                    disabled
                    people just a few generations ago. For example, smallpox vaccination eradicated that disease
                    worldwide. Your children don't have to get smallpox shots anymore because the disease no longer
                    exists. By vaccinating children against rubella (German measles), the risk that pregnant women
                    will
                    pass this virus on to their fetus or newborn has been dramatically decreased, and birth defects
                    associated with that virus no longer are seen in the United States. If we continue vaccinating
                    now,
                    and vaccinating completely, parents in the future may be able to trust that some diseases of
                    today
                    will no longer be around to harm their children in the future.</p>
